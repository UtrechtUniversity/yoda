# davrods is a mod_dav WebDAV provider. Configuration directives for davrods
# should be placed in a <Location> block.

# its default options.

        # =================================

        # provide this instead.

        # Use the 'irods' HTTP basic authentication provider, implemented by
        # davrods. This provider is used for setting up the iRODS connection,
        # and is therefore required for davrods to function.
        AuthBasicProvider irods

        # The DAV provider for this location.
        #
        # davrods implements multiple dav providers, use either:
        # - davrods-nolocks:                 WebDAV class 1 provider, no support for locking
        # - davrods-locallock (recommended): WebDAV class 2 provider, uses a DBM lock database local to this webserver
