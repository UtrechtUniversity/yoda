                                <dd>Yoda is a data repository built and maintained by Utrecht University. Yoda can store and share all kinds of scientific research data in a safe way (encrypted, stored in multiple geo locations). Yoda takes care of publishing research data with its metadata as datasets and making them findable for different harvesters. Yoda, short for Your data, is an integrated digital environment to support all kind of researchers from different backgrounds during  and after their research. Yoda is based on open source software iRODS. During the development of the key features the most important aim was to make daily life of researchers more easy as far as data management and the requirements of funders are concerned.
