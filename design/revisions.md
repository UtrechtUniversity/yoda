# Revision management

For each new file or file modification Yoda creates a timestamped backup file in the revision store. The revision store is located at `/tempZone/yoda/revisions`.

## Revision strategies
Not all revisions are kept, only a predefined number of revisions are being kept per time bucket.
A time bucket is a time offset from now into the past.
Each revision strategy has a predefined set of time buckets and number of revisions stored in those buckets.
