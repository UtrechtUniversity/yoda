## Upgrading from Yoda version 1.5
Upgrade is supported by Ansible (2.9.x).
Requires Yoda external user service to be on version 1.5.x or higher.
Requires Yoda public server to be on version 1.6.x or higher.

1. Set Yoda release to `release-1.6` in configuration.
```yaml
yoda_version: release-1.6
```

2. Set the default schema to `default-1` in configuration.
```yaml
default_yoda_schema: default-1
```

3. The core modules (`research`, `vault`, `statistics`, `group-manager`) are enabled by default in Yoda 1.6.
   Only extra modules have to be enabled in the configuration.
   So `modules` becomes `extra_modules` and all core modules should be removed from the `extra_modules` list.
   For example:
```yaml
# Yoda modules
extra_modules:
  - name: intake
    repo: "https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/yoda-portal-intake.git"
    dest: /var/www/yoda/yoda-portal/modules/intake
    version: "{{ yoda_version }}"
```

4. The core rulesets (`core` and `irods-ruleset-uu`) are enabled by default in Yoda 1.6.
   Only extra modules have to be enabled in the configuration.
   Furthermore, the research ruleset (`irods-ruleset-research`) has been merged with the UU ruleset
   (`irods-ruleset-uu`). So `rulesets` becomes `extra_rulesets`;
   `core`, `irods-ruleset-research` and `irods-ruleset-uu` should be removed from the `extra_rulesets` list.
   For example:
```
# iRODS rulesets
extra_rulesets:
  - name: irods-ruleset-youth-cohort
    repo: https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/irods-ruleset-youth-cohort.git
    ruleset_name: rules-yc
    version: "{{ yoda_version }}"
    install_scripts: no
```

5. Run the Ansible upgrade in check mode.

6. Run the Ansible upgrade.

7. Convert all metadata XML in the vault to JSON.
```bash
irule -F /etc/irods/irods-ruleset-uu/tools/check-vault-metadata-xml-for-transformation-to-json.r
```
