## Upgrading from Yoda version 1.4
Upgrade is supported by Ansible (2.7.x).
Requires Yoda public server and external user service to be on version 1.4.x or higher.

1. Set Yoda release to release-1.5 in configuration.

2. Add vault module to portal modules configuration.

3. Instance specific rulesets (e.g. `irods-ruleset-i-lab`) are merged with `irods-ruleset-uu` and should be removed from the configuration (rulesets).

4. Rename default metadata schema from `default` to `default-0` in the configuration (ensure `update_schemas` is enabled).

5. Run the Ansible upgrade in check mode.

6. Run the Ansible upgrade.

7. Add a schema identifier to all metadata on the system:
```bash
irule -F /etc/irods/irods-ruleset-research/tools/check-metadata-for-schema-updates.r
```
All metadata touched will be logged in the rodsLog.
Adding the schema identifiers can take some time, the batch script adds 256 jobs per 60 seconds to the rule queue.

8. Check if all metadata on the system has a schema identifier:
```bash
irule -F /etc/irods/irods-ruleset-research/tools/check-metadata-for-identifier.r
```

9. Update all landingpages with the new layout (if there are published packages):
```bash
irule -F /etc/irods/irods-ruleset-research/tools/update-landingpages.r
```

## Customization after upgrade (optional)

- The Ansible playbook installs default lists of preservable file formats. If you
  need to add any custom lists, follow [the procedure for installing lists of preservable file formats](../administration/installing-preservable-file-formats.md)
