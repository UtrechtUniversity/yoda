# Yoda graphic mark

This graphic mark was developed by Utrecht University for the communications about Yoda.
There are three variations of the graphic mark:

1. the entire graphic mark, including tagline and the name Yoda
2. the graphic mark and the name Yoda
3. the graphic mark only

You will find these variations in two different formats ([Adobe Illustrator](ai/) and [png](png/)), in full colour, black and white and diapositive.

## Use
For the use of the graphic mark, please use the [Yoda identity manual](yoda_identity_manual.pdf).
Only use the graphic mark in the way it is described in this manual.
