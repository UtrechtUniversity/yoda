# Development environment test users and data
When you have set up an [Yoda development environment](setting-up-development-environment.md) and provisioned it with test data the following users are created:

User                | Role
--------------------|----------
viewer              | Viewer with read only access to research groups
researcher          | Researcher with read / write access to research groups
groupmanager        | Groupmanager  with user management rights on research groups
datamanager         | Datamanager of the research groups
technicaladmin      | Technical administrator with rodsadmin access

Password for all test users is `test`.

In research group `research-initial` a folder `testdata` is created with some example data.
